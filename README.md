# Pot-Luck-game

A GUI application that presents a game based on a 5 by 5 matrix of buttons. One of the buttons (selected at random) "hides" the prize, while two of the buttons (selected at random, should be different from each other and prize button) hide bombs. A status bar at the bottom of the window shows the number of guesses. When the prize button is pressed, the status bar shows "You got it in x attempts!". When one of the bomb buttons is pressed, the status bar shows "Sorry! You are blown up at attempt x!" Which buttons hid the prize and which ones hid bombs should be revealed to the user.
